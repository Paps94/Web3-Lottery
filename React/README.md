# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

This project is the front end of the Web3 Lottery project which can be found here:

```sh
https://github.com/Paps94/Web3-Lottery
```

Assuming you were able to launch that successfully you should have a contract address and an abi (console logged).
You will need both of those for this project inside the 'lottery.js'

Additionally I assume you already have Metamask installed on your computer and switched to the Rinkeby Testnet!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
